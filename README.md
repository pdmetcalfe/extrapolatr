extrapolatr
===========

extrapolatr is (destined to be) a bunch of handy convergence
acceleration techniques.  Currently it does the reduced rank
extrapolation and minimal polynomial extrapolation methods, but it's
probably going to learn how to do other things as well.  Some
attention has been paid to numerical issues.
